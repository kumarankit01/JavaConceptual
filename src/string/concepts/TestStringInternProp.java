/*
 * Java automatically interns String literals i.e whatever is within "". This means that in many cases, 
 * the == operator appears to work for Strings in the same way that it does for 
 * ints or other primitive values.Since interning is automatic for String literals, 
 * the intern() method is to be used on Strings constructed with new String()
 * 
 * This example illustrates six points:

Literal strings within the same class (ยง8) in the same package (ยง7) represent references to the same String object (ยง4.3.1).

Literal strings within different classes in the same package represent references to the same String object.

Literal strings within different classes in different packages likewise represent references to the same String object.

Strings computed by constant expressions (ยง15.28) are computed at compile time and then treated as if they were literals.

Strings computed by concatenation at run time are newly created and therefore distinct.

The result of explicitly interning a computed string is the same string as any pre-existing literal string with the same contents.
